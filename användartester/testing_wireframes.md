Alright, let's refine the wireframes and focus on the positive aspects and potential for improvement.

### General Enhancements

*   **Emphasize Visual Appeal:** Even in wireframes, consider the visual flow. Use whitespace effectively to avoid a cluttered look.
*   **Interactive Elements:** Think about how users will interact with each element. Highlight interactive components (buttons, links) to make them noticeable.
*   **Consistency is Key:** Maintain consistent design patterns (navigation, button styles, typography) across all pages.

### Specific Page Improvements

1.  **Homepage**

    *   **Positive**: The homepage includes key elements: a welcome section, a call-to-action button, events, and sponsors.
    *   **Enhancements**:
        *   **Welcome Section**: Use a high-quality image that showcases the joy of horseback riding. A photo of happy riders or well-groomed horses would be inviting.
        *   **Call to Action**: Make the "Prova på att rida!" button larger and use a more vibrant color. Add a brief, enticing description next to the button, such as "Book Your First Ride Today!"
        *   **Events**: Showcase upcoming events prominently. Use visually appealing blocks with images and short descriptions to draw users in.
2.  **Category/Article Page

    *   **Positive**: The article layout is simple and easy to understand.
    *   **Enhancements**:
        *   **Article Previews**: Instead of just "Artikel," include a captivating title and a brief summary of each article.
        *   **Visual Variety**: Alternate the layout of the article blocks (image on the left, then on the right) to create visual interest.
        *   **Category Navigation**: Add clear category labels and links at the top of the page.
3.  **General Layout 

    *   **Positive**: Inclusion of a calendar and contact information is great for user accessibility.
    *   **Enhancements**:
        *   **"Våra hästar (banderoller)"**: This section can be a great way to showcase the horses. Use high-quality images and brief descriptions to highlight each horse's personality and achievements.
        *   **Calendar**: Integrate the calendar directly into the page.
4.  **Navigation**

    *   **Positive**: You have a navigation bar in the header.
    *   **Enhancements**:
        *   **Clear Labels**: Use clear and descriptive labels for navigation items (e.g., "About Us," "Lessons," "Events," "Contact").
        *   **Dropdown Menus**: If there are many pages, use dropdown menus to organize the navigation.
        *   **Search Bar**: Place a search bar in the header for easy access to specific content.

By focusing on these enhancements, the wireframes can be transformed into a user-friendly design that invites visitors to engage with SHRKI and explore all the wonderful opportunities it offers.
